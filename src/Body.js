        Hey, I'm Miles, a software engineer.<br/>
        I enjoy building products which help users lead richer, fuller, more human lives, not reduce them to extensions of an algorithm.<br/>
        My interests are data visualization and analysis, intuitive and beautiful user experiences, and music.<br/>
