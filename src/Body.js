      <h2>Miles Marillo: Fullstack Developer</h2>
      <p>
      Hello, I'm a NYC-based full stack software engineer, working in React, Node, JavaScript, HTML5, SQL, CSS, Ruby/Rails, Gatsby.js and whatever. 
      Before coming to tech, he was a modern-dance critic, an animal-shelter volunteer, the artistic director of a comedy theater and, briefly, a reality televison personality. 
      He is a proud graduate of the Flatiron School Access Labs program. 
        I enjoy building products which help users lead richer, fuller, more human lives, not reduce them to extensions of an algorithm.<br/>
        My interests are data visualization and analysis, intuitive and beautiful user experiences, and music.<br/>
      </p>
